        to facilitate exchange of value where conventional banks can not operate e.g in
        conflict zones and failed states.This is the new way of sending and receiving
        value through the mobile phone.Safari enables you to trade with your peers and you will
        get profits for every transaction that is facilitated through your mobile phone.
        You will make more profits by choosing to act as agent to your peers after successful login.
        Safari will credit your account with 1000 safaris(Safari's unit of value) with wich you can only invest
        in an active agent to start and facilitate the  transaction process. Investing
        in very active agents will give you more returns on your investments. Therefore,
        you just need to switch on you data connection,get into Safari and create resources
        through your phone, which can equate money at  where the safari is accepted as mode of payment. If our world fails,
        or if we decided to migrate to Mars, Safari will STILL be there for us. WE  WILL NOT BE LET DOWN BY THE PRESENT BANKING SYSTEM!
